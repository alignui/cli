## Introduction

A CLI for adding AlignUI's Tailwind styles to your project.

## Usage

Use the `tailwind` command to initialize tailwind for your project. You need to do this in your project directory and make sure you have installed Tailwind CSS.

> [!CAUTION]
> This will overwrite your CSS and `tailwind.config` files.

```bash
npx @alignui/cli tailwind
```

This command will detect if you're using TypeScript, install the necessary packages, ask for your preferred primary color and color format, and prompt you to choose a prefix for AlignUI's classes if youâ€™d like.

> [!NOTE]  
> A CSS file with Tailwind directives and a `tailwind.config` file must exist in your project.
